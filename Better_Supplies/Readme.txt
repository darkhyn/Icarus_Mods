## Description:
- I found it weird that people fly lightyears in space but don't even have food rations they can take down to the planet, so...
- This will help you a lot initially after your drop and will make the overall game less grindy. 
- makes it easily possible to drop with just workshop gear and complete most missions without setting up base somewhere first.
- this mod adds a workshop menu called "Better Supplies". In this menu, you can find the following items:
- a food carepackage which provides 10x space jerky and 10x space jelly. Each uses one stomach slot.
